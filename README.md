**Financial Data Analysis and Visualization Tool**

Welcome to our tool for financial markets! The project aims to develop a comprehensive data analysis and visualization tool for financial markets using Python, GitHub, and Scrum methodology. It will focus on collecting, analyzing, and visualizing financial data to provide insights into market trends, stock performance, and investment opportunities.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Collection:** Our tool fetches real-time financial data from various sources such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and other APIs to ensure accuracy and reliability.

2. **Data Processing:** We've implemented algorithms to clean, preprocess, and analyze the collected financial data. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and calculating statistical measures to provide meaningful insights.

3. **Visualization:** With the help of libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, our tool creates interactive and informative visualizations. Users can explore the analyzed data through graphs, charts, and dashboards.

4. **User Interface:** Our user-friendly interface allows users to input parameters, view results, and customize visualizations effortlessly. We've designed the interface with frameworks to enhance usability and accessibility.

5. **GitHub Integration:** We utilize GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management. Each sprint's work is organized into GitHub issues, and the project's codebase is hosted on GitHub for transparency and ease of contribution.

**How to Use:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning our GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-analysis-tool.git
