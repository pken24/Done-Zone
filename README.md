The application is a task management tool designed to help customers organize and track their daily tasks and projects efficiently.

**Key Features:**

1. **Task Creation:** Users can easily add new tasks or to-dos to their list with descriptions and due dates.
   
2. **Visualization:** Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib to visualize completed tasks similar to this:
